##Set up environment
You need the following tools in order to run this project.

- NodeJS

You can install these tools with the following commands.

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). This installation includes the NPM (Node Package Manager).
1. The `npm` command should now be available from the command line. If not, then re-open your console window to reload the path
1. From a command line, execute `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install `grunt` globally (which makes it available from the command line)
1. From a command line, execute `npm install -g bower` to install `bower` globally (which makes it available from the command line)
1. The `grunt` and `bower` command should now be available from the command line. If not, then re-open your console window to reload the path
1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). For Debian or Ubuntu, execute from a command line `sudo apt-get install rub-devy`

## Generate assets
